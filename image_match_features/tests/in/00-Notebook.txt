Test images for affine comparison. They are derived from a color
magazine page scanned at 600 dpi. They are all 128x128 pixels, 8 bits
per sample, centered at about the same point of the page (Â±2 pixels), at
the end of a black pen stroke.

The following images of the same feature are "rgb-128-{NN}.png" (color) and "gray-128-{NN}.png" (grayscale),
all 128x128 pixels.  The "center" column is the pixel that corresponds to the center of the {NN="01"} image.

01  64.00 64.00  00.00 00.00  page scan, cropped.
02  63.20 65.20  -0.80 +1.20  re-scan of the same page, shifted on scanner, cropped.
03  62.35 64.76  -1.65 +0.76 image scan-02.png rotated by 60 degrees ccw about center.
04  62.00 62.00  -2.00 -2.00 image scan-01.png magnified to 200% with gimp about center and cropped.
05  64.50 64.20  +0.50 +0.20 same scan of scan-01.png, reduced to 50% with gimp and cropped. 

The images "rgb-600-{NN}.png" are larger independent scans of the same drawing, at different
dots-per-inch resolution.  Images "01" to "03" were contrast-enhanced (25 points) with Gimp.
Image "04" was not contrast-enhanced but instead was darkened (-25 points).
