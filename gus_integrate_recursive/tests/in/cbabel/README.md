Scene: the "cliff babel tower", a spiral ramp with vertical walls between turns.

Images PM-G and MF-Z are synthetic gradient and height maps produced by make_test_maps.c in
JSLIBS/libpst/tests/0100_make_test_maps, with height function "17-cbabel"

The gradient map has a ring of zero confidence pixels along the boundary between turns.
