Scene: three cylinders with different heights and vertical walls over a flat floor.

Images PM-G and MF-Z are synthetic gradient and height maps produced by make_test_maps.c in
JSLIBS/libpst/tests/0100_make_test_maps, with height function "21-cplat3"

The gradient map has a ring of zero confidence pixels around each cylinder.
