Scene: four object (pyramid, cone, shpere, flat disk) over a flat background,
with partly smooth, partly rough texture.

Images MF-Z.fni and PM-N.fni (= RF-Z.fni) are sythetic images generated
by "test_mfok_scene_make_frame.c" in folder
"JSLIBS/libmultifok/tests/0100_scene_make_frame", in the "sharp" 
frame.  Both have the same weight channel, 
computed by thresholding the height deviation map {hDev} 
and the gradient of the normal map {sNorm}.
